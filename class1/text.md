How can we set up the development environment using VS Code and Browser DevTools, and understand the basics of variables (var, let, const) and data types (strings, numbers, booleans) ?

*IDE*

(Integrated Development Environment) is software that provides tools to help developers write, debug, and manage code efficiently.

*Browser DevTools*

Key Features:
Elements Tab: View and edit HTML and CSS in real-time.
Console Tab: Check errors and test JavaScript code.
Network Tab: Monitor network requests like API calls and resource loading.
Performance Tab: Analyze and improve website speed.

Key Points

Purpose: Variables allow you to reuse data without writing it repeatedly.
How to Declare: Use keywords like var, let, or const in JavaScript.
Naming Rules:Must start with a letter, $, or _.
Cannot have spaces or special characters (except $ and _).
Case-sensitive (e.g., Name and name are different).
{Real Life Example}
let apples = 5; // Save the number of apples in a variable
apples = 10; // Change the value when you need more apples

<!-- var ki madad sy ap declear bhe karsakhty ho value bhe change kar sakhty ho

let ki madad sy sirf value change hoti ha

const ki madad sy value fix rehtiha hamesha -->
